# WeeBoo | My Anime List

### WeeBoo from Anime-App

[WeeBoo | My Anime List](https://nantunggaputra.github.io/React_Library/Frontend_React_by_WPU/anime-app/weeboo/) is a Front-End SPA (Single Page Application) Web project built using [React](https://react.dev/) to display a list of anime. This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for bundling and Visual Studio Code as the code editor. Mostly anime data is fetched from the [Jikan - Unofficial MyAnimeList API](https://docs.api.jikan.moe/).

WeeBoo is designed and developed by [Nantungga Putra](https://nantunggaputra.github.io/HTML/), also later dedicated development team under Open Source Contribution.

## Features (Under Development)

## Using the Jikan REST API v4

To use the Jikan REST API v4, you need to import and call the provided endpoints. Example of an API call to get the latest anime list:

```jsx
import axios from "axios";

const fetchAnime = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get(`https://api.jikan.moe/v4/anime`);
    console.log(response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
    setTimeout(() => {
      alert(`${error}\nYour Error Message.`);
      window.location.reload();
    });
    return [];
  }
};
```
