While staying with his grandfather, the owner of a game shop, he comes across an ancient Egyption relic known as the 'Millennium Puzzle.' Rumored to grant any wish to those who solve the Puzzle, Yuugi becomes determined to solve it to wish for some friends. After years of struggling, Yuugi manages to complete the puzzle and mysteriously finds that his wish has been fulfilled. Meanwhile, a new card game known as 'Duel Monsters' starts rising in popularity. In this game, players called duelists fight against each other with 'monsters' by using magic and trap cards to foil their opponent's plans. Yuugi quickly becomes skilled at the game and lives a peaceful life with his newfound friends. However, Yuugi's peace is short-lived. The undefeated duelist and egocentric billionaire Seto Kaiba suddenly abducts Yuugi's grandfather, forcing him to duel against the rare 'Blue Eyes White Dragon' card. Yuugi is thrown into a new world of fierce battles and the stakes continue to rise as dark forces interfere from the shadows. After unexpectedly defeating Kaiba with the help of his 'other self'—the spirit of a nameless pharaoh—contained in the puzzle, he unofficially becomes the top duelist known as 'The King of Games.' However, this new 'title' will attract covetousness and Yuugi will have to use all his intelligence and willpower in order to protect what he holds the dearest to him. [Written by MAL Rewrite]"

Gokuu happens to be in possession of a dragon ball, but unfortunately for Bulma, he refuses to part ways with it, so she makes him a deal: he can tag along on her journey if he lets her borrow the dragon ball's power. With that, the two set off on the journey of a lifetime. They don't go on the journey alone. On the way, they meet the old Muten-Roshi and wannabe disciple Kuririn, with whom Gokuu trains to become a stronger martial artist for the upcoming World Martial Arts Tournament. However, it's not all fun and games; the ability to make any wish come true is a powerful one, and there are others who would do much worse than just wishing for a boyfriend. To stop those who would try to abuse the legendary power, they train to become stronger fighters, using their newfound strength to help the people around them along the way. [Written by MAL Rewrite]"
